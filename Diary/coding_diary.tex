\section{20.10.2020} 
Dear Diary,\\
After reading the introduction of the course, I replicated the Word Template for the diary in \LaTeX using Texmaker as a GUI for writing. I managed finding my old Github Account then and installed Git on my Ubuntu system. I decided using Fork for my version control because I used it before and I am familiar with the program.
\section{22.10.2020}
I wanted to download Fork but I realised that Fork (and SourceTree) don't have a Linux Version. During watching the Introduction to Version Control I saw that the code editor Atom has an implemented version control GUI, so I decided to take that one.\\
Afterwards I watched the video about Node.js. Because I planned improving my Python skills this semester I realised that the course is made for JavaScript, which I didn't use before so it is a whole new challenge for me. Regarding the point that JavaScript is useful for sending/getting data from a server, I am looking forward to it.\\
I already have an idea for a JS application. With a friend of mine I was planning to make a simple ToDo-list application using the Python. For storing (and checking) the entries of the list on a server, I am thinking about using JavaScript.\\
Now I am setting up my Git-Repository and placing the Texmaker-Workspace, the Exercises Workspace and the ProjectWorkspace in there. During this I am getting familiar with the code editor Atom and the Github implementation in it
